## How can I contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

Please use __Github Issues__ to report bugs. When filling out an issue report,
make sure to copy any related code and stack traces so we can properly debug.
We need to be able to reproduce a failing test to be able to fix your issue
most of the time, so a custom written failing test is very helpful.

### Suggesting Enhancements

Please use __Github Issues__ to suggest enhancements. We are happy to consider
any extra functionality or features to the library, as long as they add real
and related value to users. Describing your use case and why such an addition
helps the user base can help guide the decision to implement it into the
library's core.

### Pull Requests

* Include new test cases (either end-to-end or unit tests) with your change.
* Follow our style guides.
* Make sure all tests are still passing and the linter does not report any issues.
* End files with a new line.
* Make sure your branch is up to date and rebased.
* Squash extraneous commits unless their history truly adds value to the library.
