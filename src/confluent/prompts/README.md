# Prompts Directory

This folder contains all prompt-related features for the MCP server, following the Model Context Protocol (https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/prompts).

- Place prompt definitions, prompt handlers, and related utilities here.
- Each prompt should be implemented as a module or class, with clear documentation and usage examples.

Example: To implement a prompt for Confluent Cloud metrics by principal, create a file like `metrics-by-principal.prompt.ts` in this directory.
