/**
 * Wires every client getter on a fresh `Mocked<DirectClientManager>` to a
 * two-proxy pair so handler bodies can traverse arbitrary method chains
 * (`.GET(...)`, `.POST(...)`, `.path(...).method(...)`, etc.) without throwing
 * a TypeError. Every async call resolves to a proxy that models the
 * `{ data, error, response }` shape returned by `openapi-fetch`.
 *
 * ## `responseData` — single value
 *
 * Pass a plain object; it becomes `(await call()).data`. Shape it to match
 * what the handler reads:
 * ```typescript
 * // handler does: const { data } = await client.GET(...); data.status.phase
 * stubClientGetters({ status: { phase: "COMPLETED" }, results: { data: [] } })
 * ```
 *
 * Two special top-level keys override the defaults:
 * - `response` — surfaced as `(await call()).response`. Use for handlers that
 *   destructure `response` directly, e.g. DELETE endpoints that check
 *   `response?.status`:
 *   ```typescript
 *   stubClientGetters({ response: { status: 204 } })
 *   ```
 * - `error` — surfaced as `(await call()).error`. Use to exercise a handler's
 *   error branch (`if (error) return this.createResponse(..., true)`):
 *   ```typescript
 *   stubClientGetters({ error: { message: "not found" } })
 *   ```
 *
 * ## `responseData` — array of elements
 *
 * Pass an array to feed different data to successive calls. Each element
 * follows the same shape contract above. The last element is reused once the
 * array is exhausted, so you only need to enumerate the calls that differ:
 * ```typescript
 * // handler: POST to create → GET to poll status → GET to fetch results
 * stubClientGetters([
 *   {},                                                    // POST (ignored)
 *   { status: { phase: "COMPLETED" } },                   // GET poll
 *   { results: { data: [{ COLUMN_NAME: "id" }] } },       // GET results
 * ])
 * ```
 *
 * Returns `{ clientManager, clientGetters, capturedCalls }`.
 * - Pass `clientGetters` to `assertHandleCase` to assert the handler reached
 *   the client layer on a successful resolve.
 * - `capturedCalls` is a `CapturedCall[]`; each entry has `.pathTemplate` (the
 *   raw OpenAPI path string) and `.args` (the `{ params, body, ... }` object).
 *   Use it to assert what the handler actually sent to the REST layer, e.g.
 *   POST body contents or query params. Only REST (path-based) clients produce
 *   entries; zero-arg proxy-chain calls are silently skipped.

 * Runs `handler.handle(runtime, args)` and asserts the outcome matches the

 * and the global smoke suite.
 *
 * @param handler - The handler under test. Only `handle()` is required; pass
 *   the full handler instance or any `Pick<BaseToolHandler, "handle">`.
 * @param runtime - The `ServerRuntime` injected into `handle()`. Build it with
 *   `runtimeWith(connectionConfig, connectionId, clientManager)` so the
 *   connection shape and mock client are both under test control.
 * @param args - Tool arguments forwarded to `handle()`. Defaults to `{}`.
 *   Supply only the fields relevant to the case under test.
 * @param outcome - What to expect: `{ resolves: substring }` asserts the
 *   response text contains the substring; `{ throws: substring }` asserts the
 *   thrown error message contains it (or `"ZodError"` for any `ZodError`);
 *   the discovery sentinel runs the handler and fails with a copy-paste
 *   suggestion for the correct entry (see `HandleOutcome`).
 * @param clientGetters - When supplied, asserts that at least one getter was
 *   called on a successful resolve, proving the handler reached the client
 *   layer. Omit in cases that short-circuit before touching the client.
 *   (Obtain from the `clientGetters` field returned by `stubClientGetters()`.)
 * @param name - Label prepended to assertion failure messages and used in
 *   discovery-sentinel output. Defaults to `"(handler)"`.
